Based on the [deej project](https://github.com/omriharel/deej). Should work as a client for vanilla Deej hardware as it uses the same protocol.

This implementation is entirely Python based and exposes more options for customization of the algorithm for denoising the input. There is also support for digital channels which can be used to mute audio devices and applications.
